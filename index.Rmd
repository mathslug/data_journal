## About News Bits

[**News Bits**](./index.html) is currently a random website without even a real url that adds no value to anything. Here's the [Github repo](https://github.com/mathslug/data_journal)

## Latest Articles

Currently most of these are just random links to my blog as placeholders, except for the sample article.

Here's a [webapp](https://mathslug.shinyapps.io/exoplanetShiny/) to visualize exoplanet data that we could embed in an article. Here's another [shiny app](https://mathslug.shinyapps.io/InterventionSignificanceTest2/).

Here's some random data.
```{r fig.width=6, fig.height=6, fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}
set.seed(123)
n <- 1000
x1  <- matrix(rnorm(n), ncol = 2)
x2  <- matrix(rnorm(n, mean = 3, sd = 1.5), ncol = 2)
x   <- rbind(x1, x2)
smoothScatter(x, xlab = "x1", ylab = "x2")
```
